# Realtime_WC_Noise
This is a quickly written viewer of Kongsberg water column data with the express purpose of looking for noise.  It is not built to 
be a robust, field deployed application, so use at your own risk.

Change the port to listen to (for water column data) in the MACNoiseViewer than then run it.
